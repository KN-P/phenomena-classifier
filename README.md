# phenomena-classifier

This project provides a basic implementation for training of a deep learning model that classifies geophysical phenomena from SAR images.

## Working

This deep learning model uses ResNet as the base model. And transfer learning is used to add extra layers to train the model and adapt it to the new dataset.
